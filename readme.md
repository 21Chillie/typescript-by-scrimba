# 🎯 Welcome to TypeScript — Scrimba Course

> Learn how to write safer, more reliable JavaScript with **TypeScript** — and apply it in **Express** and **React** projects.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This course introduces you to **TypeScript**, a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that helps you catch errors _before_ your code runs.

In just **4 hours**, you'll master the essentials and learn how to integrate TypeScript effectively into real-world **Express** and **React** projects.

---

## 💡 Why Learn TypeScript?

TypeScript makes your code:

- 🧱 **Safer** – catches errors at compile time instead of runtime
- 🔍 **Easier to maintain** – strong typing improves refactoring and collaboration
- ⚡ **Faster to scale** – confidently build larger, more complex apps

Whether you’re building APIs or user interfaces, TypeScript helps you write clean, predictable, and self-documented code.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

### 🧩 TypeScript Fundamentals

- Basic, literal, and custom types
- Arrays, objects, and optional properties
- Union types, narrowing, and utility types
- Generics and advanced type tricks

### ⚛️ TypeScript in React

- Initialize a React + TypeScript project
- Type `useState`, `props`, and components
- Handle JSX that may return `null`

### 🌐 TypeScript in Express

- Set up a TypeScript-powered Express server
- Typed requests, responses, and route data
- Handle CORS, 404s, IDs, and query parameters
- Automate server restarts confidently with `ts-node-dev`

---

## 🧰 Tools & Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- A code editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Express or React
- TypeScript compiler (`npm install -g typescript`)

---

## 🧪 Course Goals

By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand **how TypeScript enhances JavaScript**
- Build a **React app** with fully typed props and state
- Develop an **Express API** with typed routes and middleware
- Configure **TypeScript tooling** for real-world development

---

## 🏗️ After Completing the Course

To strengthen your skills:

- Convert a small JavaScript project (e.g., an Express API or React component) into TypeScript
- Explore **advanced TypeScript topics** (e.g., discriminated unions, custom type guards)
- Integrate TypeScript with a database ORM (like Prisma or TypeORM)
