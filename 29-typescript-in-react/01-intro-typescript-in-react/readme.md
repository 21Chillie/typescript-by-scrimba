# TypeScript with React

Welcome to the next section of the **Learn TypeScript** course, where we’ll explore how TypeScript and React work together.

In this section, we’ll take an existing React project and progressively add TypeScript to make it safer, more predictable, and easier to maintain.

---

## Project Overview

We’ll be working with a familiar project called **Assembly Endgame**, a hangman-style game where each incorrect letter guess removes a programming language until only *Assembly* remains.

The gameplay already works — our focus is **reworking the project with TypeScript**, not rebuilding its logic.

## What You’ll Learn

### 1. TypeScript Refresher
A short review of core TypeScript concepts to get back up to speed before diving into React-specific features.

### 2. Typing React State and Components
Learn how to:
- Type `useState` hooks
- Type functional components
- Understand how TypeScript infers React types automatically

### 3. Typing Component Props
We’ll cover multiple approaches:
- Inline prop typing
- Custom prop type aliases
- Importing prop types from external files

### 4. Typing Function Props
Explore one of the most common and important React + TypeScript patterns — defining types for callback props passed between components.

## Learning Format

Throughout this section:
- You’ll work directly with React components
- You’ll receive incremental challenges to apply what you’ve learned
- Each concept builds on the previous one to form a complete workflow

---

## Goal

By the end of this section, you’ll be able to:
- Confidently type your own React components
- Use TypeScript to catch common React errors early
- Structure React codebases with explicit, well-defined types

**Next:** Let’s start with a quick TypeScript refresher before moving into React-specific typing patterns.
